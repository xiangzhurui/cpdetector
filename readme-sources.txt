The sources in form of an eclipse 3.5 project. 

Usage: 
 1) Dowload the desired version. 
 2) Deflate it (use winrar, winzip, ...).
 3) Start eclipse. 
 4) Choose: file->import->existing project into workspace.
 5) Point to the deflated directory "cpdetector"
 6) Start developing. I recommend to use the shipped 
    ANT build.xml: Right click the file and choose 
    "ANT build...". 
 
 7) Contribute, report bugs, read the LGPL! 
 	I understand urgent projects and the conflict that I - as a hobby developer - 
 	cannot integrate your patches or implement your bug reports / feature requests 
 	in the time you need for your project. But if you fork with highly project proprietary 
 	solutions you will have to continue development on your own and not be able to 
 	update to the newest generic features of this library. 
	Open Source needs feedback.
