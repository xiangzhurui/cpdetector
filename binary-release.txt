This zipfile contains the java libaries needed to run cpdetector. 

If you want to use the command line tool info.monitorenter.cpdetector.CodepageProcessor 
(java -jar cpdetector_version.jar) you have to use jargs.jar. 

If you integrate cpdetector in your java application you just need 
to use: 
- chardet.jar
- antlr.jar

antlr.jar is version 2.7.4. Porting to version 3 has been stopped after 
encountering some problems with packages an required import for lexer 
to specify lexer options in combination with non-unamed package.
