	<name>Chinese Test #6: Big5</name>
	<data>This file has CDATA which looks like
	a decimal numeric character reference. It is a Big5 encoded
	file with no non-ASCII characters (i.e. it is also a
	UTF-8, ASCII or iso-8859-n file).
	</data>
	<data>The XML header of this file is
	&lt;?xml encoding="Big5"?&gt;.
	</data>
	<data><![CDATA[The character is here: [&#20013;].]]>
	It is not the Chinese character for middle.
	It should not look like a box with a vertical
	line through its middle.
