     <h2>Request new features</h2>
     <p>
      cpdetector is quite stable now. But still some features are missing and may 
      be desireable. It will tried to add these by doing it in a clever order: 
      First the basic features that will be needed by the more advanced ones. 
      This allows to keeps it clean and stable without long terms of blind development 
      (unable to perform a build). 
      </p>
      <p>
       cpdetector is quite small and simple. Extensions with new code page -  detection 
       implementations may be done without affecting other code as these implementations 
       are only taken into the code path if the user configures the proxy. Further implementations 
       are welcome. Extensions of existing implementations like the ANTLR facade or 
       the proxy itself have to be cross - checked or done by a team member.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the unofficial roadmap it is important to know, 
       which features are most desirable for the users. <br>
       So it is important to let us (by now only me) know about 
       it: <br>
