     <h2>Donations for cpdetector</h2>
     <p>
      cpdetector has been a side product needed for performance 
      measurements of a completely new unconventional unicode normalization algorithm. 
      Actually I was searching for 
      an application that could do the things cpdetector does for free 
      on the internet. I did only find a java port of mozilla's chardet algorithm 
      and found differences between the judgement of it and defined 
      charset attributes (although the guess was quite close and the 
      documents decoded with that code page looked quite reasonable). 
     </p>
     <p>
      It has to be pointed out, that cpdetector is free for everyone. 
      Nevertheless some effort and hours were spent to make it clean 
      and stable.
      If you are incredible rich or think that the effort on cpdetector should 
      be rewarded (or both) you are encouraged to donate money.
     </p>
     <h3>Why donate?</h3>
     <p>
      <ol>
      	<li>
         Reward the programmers of cpdetector. They will be encouraged to 
         continue development by adding requested features and improving 
         stability.
       	<li>
       	 Reward Sourceforge and the Open Source Initiative with 
       	 each 5% of your donations. Especially sourceforge earns some 
       	 money for providing many open source projects with a complete 
       	 project - management solution including downloads, concurrent versioning 
       	 systems, free web-hosting, ... .
       </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>How to donate?</h3>
      <p>
       Just click the following link and follow the instructions. 
       You might have to sign up to paypal, an international payment system 
       based on your email address. But it does not take much time and does 
       not introduce security issues.
