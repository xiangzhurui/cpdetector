Version 1.04: Minor Bugfix

- Sync with new source release...

Version 1.03: 

- First start with FIT testing (ANTFIT). 
1.04:
- Bugfix for "missing fit task".
- Restructuring the archive: top-level folder is now project root. 

1.03: 
- Removal of java 1.5 sourcecode for consistency. 
- Rebuild of jchardet for jdk1.4.2. 
- Start of ANT - integrated FIT testing: see http://fit.c2.com/ 

FIT Howto: 
This testing framework produces human readable beautiful 
output and does not require programming skills. Just a html page  
has to be written. The first class that processes the data is 
provided in cpdetector. Even the programming of the test 
classes causes minimal effort. 

Please look at: cpdetector/test/fit/detectURL.html. In that file 
there is only one table row that runs a test. You could help by 
adding other rows that reference the files from the 
testdocuments that are available in the release
- Step back to jdk 1.4.2 (Test sources were 1.5). 
- Choosable guessing of charsets: If jchardet fails to narrow 
  down the set of possible charsets to one, it may (if chosen) 
  return a potential one. 
  See cpdetector.io.JChardetFacade.setGuessing(boolean). 


Version 1.02: 

Bugfix (unreported): 
Version 1.01 introduced a major bug that disabled html charset parsing. This has been verified to result from the behaviour of the parser generator and fixed. 

Bugfix (unreported): 
CodpageDetectorProxy iterated over the  ICodepageDetector implementations in an arbitrary order thus ignoring the precedence. 

Feature:
Support for XML external parsed entities (e.g.: dtd's) with optional version info. 

Feature:
Build automation. 

Feature: 
Start of quality assurance with integrations of junit in ANT.



Version 1.01: 

- ANTLR parsing now detects XML encoding 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#NT-EncodingDecl)
  This offers a performance speedup when handling 
  mainly xml, as the fallback guessing algorithm may 
  be skipped. 

- New interface method for InputStreams allows working with
  any data (even byte arrays or Strings). 

- Deprecated HTMLCharsetDetector due to a misleading name: 
  ANTLR parsing looks for xml encodin as well as html charset 
  and will possibly include more in future.  The new 
  implementation is called ParsingDetector.
